# Fleaflea (New Levels)
The new Fleaflea levels! Check out the README on the oldlevels branch to read the manual. Relevant sections for this release include the synopsis, controls, and general gameplay loop.

Welcome to the land of Carañajo! Characterized by beautiful skies and lush green mountainsides, take a journey through this region!

To start off, there are 4 new levels in this branch. All of the old content still exists in the rooms after the final level, but it's not intended to be here and may crash the game. Basically, after the one and only Marta level in the clouds, consider yourself done with this release.

Some changes were made from the old version. Here are the major ones:

- You now restart from checkpoints with whichever powerup you had
- The IWing's sprite was changed
- Marta can now kill Goopies by diving

These levels aimed to be longer and of higher quality than the old ones (you can be the judge of that).

Here are some specific hints:

- On level 3, Marta will get the key for you. Basically, don't worry at all about the key.
- On level 3, after the first checkpoint, you'll have to scale a couple of mountains with trampolines. Once you get the Super Shoe, there will be a wall of breakable blocks to your left. Once you break those, you'll see a trampoline. You'll want to fling yourself to the left - there'll be land there, but it's unintuitive without knowing about it in advance.

Enjoy the game. It's not very different from the old version, but hopefully the new levels are more interesting.
