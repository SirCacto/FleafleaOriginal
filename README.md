# Welcome to Fleaflea!

First, I apologize for the unusual structure of this repository.

This is Fleaflea, a 2D platformer made in GameMaker.

This is a game I tried making a couple of years back. This version of the Fleaflea idea is now complete and unfinished, so I decided to publish the work I had on GitHub.

This main branch is solely used for this README. There are other branches here: one for old levels, and one for new levels. Essentially, I originally made some levels that seemed fun. However, at one point, I decided to make a few new levels that felt longer and a bit more polished. While the old levels are technically still included in the newer level release, they should be disregarded, as some do not work properly.

There are two releases in this repository. One for the old levels, and one for the new one. Each branch has its own README with important information. I suggest reading the oldlevels branch first, as it contains information that is later referenced in newlevels.

As mentioned, I am no longer working on this project. However, the Fleaflea concept still remains in my mind. Maybe someday I'll go back to it.

Much of this game is very simple, especially the textures. They were meant to be placeholders while I focused on adding gameplay elements.

The sound design was done entirely by me, although not all of the songs were necessarily made for this game.

I hope you enjoy Fleaflea to some extent. I realize this game is a bit buggy, very unpolished, and unintuitive at times. However, it was a great introduction to GameMaker. First, I'd suggest playing the old levels, then trying the new ones. Before anything else, I'd suggest reading the README in the oldlevels branch to see if you'd like the game.

Thanks.
