# Fleaflea
The original Fleaflea game! While unfinished, it can still provide some short-term fun. You can see my retrospective on the README file on the main branch.

This README will act as a simple manual for the game. This will tell you the controls, as well as anything else worth saying. Enjoy!


Synopsis: In this game, control Fleaflea the fly and Marta the ladybug to platform through levels!

General Controls:
- Arrows - Move L/R
- Up Arrow - Jump
- Hold X or Shift - Run
- R - Restart Level (or from Checkpoint)

Fleaflea Controls:
- Up Arrow (Midair) - Fly

Marta Controls:
- Up Arrow (Midair) - Dive
- Up Arrow (Mid-dive) - Cancel Dive

Super Shoe Controls (While Moving):
- Z - Increase to Stage 1
- Z (While in Stage 1) - Increase to Stage 2

Beetle Bulb Controls:
- Z - Dash

Debug Controls:
- O/P - Move back or forward a level
- C - Reset checkpoint

The general goal of each level is to find the key and then the rocket. Not all levels are like this, 
but most are. If you can’t find one of these objects in the level, assume that you have to 
complete some other objective to pass it. Additionally, if you complete the level but it restarts, 
you might have to try another path…

Powerups:
- The IWing (Improved Wing) looks like a propeller. It gives you an additional midair flap as 
Fleaflea. Additionally, if you touch a rainbow Flight Crystal, you’ll get another flap as well.

- The Super Shoe allows you to run faster. By advancing your stage through the use of the 
controls above and running, you’ll gain speed. You’ll reset to stage 0 if you stop moving or 
change direction when grounded. On stage 1, you can kill Goopies (the little blue dudes who first appear in level 6). On stage 2, you can break 
through orange blocks.

- The Beetle Bulb looks like a small red berry. When you pick it up as Marta, your dive will now boost upward. Additionally, you gain the ability to do a midair dash by pressing Z. If you see a checkered wall, you'll need to dash to pass through it.

Marta can break through orange blocks with her dive ability.

There are currently 12 levels and a debug room. There are several gizmos that I didn’t highlight here, but those are for you to discover!







More Specific Hints:

- To kill Goopies with the Super Shoe, you have to be on stage 1 and run. To break blocks, you have to be on stage 2 and run.

- To obtain the key on level 6, you have to kill all of the Goopies.

- Some levels have multiple keys and/or exits. If you pick up one key, the others will disappear.

- There are 3 exits from level 7, but only one of them actually works (the yellow trampoline).

- You start level 8 with the Super Shoe.

Have fun!
